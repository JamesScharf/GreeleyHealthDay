# GreeleyHealthDay

9/18/15: Initial commit of all work done by J. Scharf so far.
Goal: Create a website for the "Greeley Senior Health Day", where teachers can create classes which are dynmically added to a total list of classes, and students can then view the catolog of classes and add themselves to it based on a first-come-first-serve basis until the max student amount per class is reached. Administrators should also be able to view all class rosters as a master schedule and be able to print out an individual student's schedule. If possible, all data should only be included once in the SQL (as of now, the student's classes are registered in a personal schedule, and the classes register the student's name onto their roster).

Please do not share this code.
